	<h2> What is identity theft? </h2>
	<p> Identity theft is a serious crime, and it is one where your personal information has been jeopardized.
	</p>
	<h2> Well, I don't have anything to hide. Why does it matter? </h2>
	<p> The fraudster can rack up significant debt in your name, leave you with a criminal record, and do much more with just your Social Insurance Number. </p>
